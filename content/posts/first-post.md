title: 'My blog is back!'
summary: 'After 6 years, I have decided to revive my blog.'

Last time I wrote here was in 2019, that was back in my junior year of college.

Most of the posts from that time were simply summaries or notes from the books I read, without much personal reflection.
If you're curious, you can still find those old posts in [my old site repository](https://github.com/jerry871002/my-hugo-website/tree/master/content/posts).

(Side note: That old repo exists because I somehow decided to separate the site code and the generated content into two repositories.
The `public` directory was set up as a Git submodule.
After building the site into `public` and pushing the changes, the site would be deployed to GitHub Pages.
I can't remember why I did it that way, but these days, the [recommended approach](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/) is to keep everything in a single repository and let Github Actions take care of the deployment.)

Anyway, this time around, I hope to make this blog more personal.
I'll try to share some of my own thoughts and experiences as I continue learning and finding my way over the years.

I'll also try to write more often, but no promises 😉.
