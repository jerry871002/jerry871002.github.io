Hi all, I‚Äôm Jerry üëã

I‚Äôm a software developer from Taiwan, currently living and working in Finland.
I specialize in backend development, cloud-native technologies, and security, with a strong interest in distributed systems.

I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering with a cross-disciplinary focus in computer science at **National Chiao Tung University** (now part of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, NYCU) in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

After that, I was fortunate to be awarded an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to join the **Security and Cloud Computing (SECCLO)** master's program, a joint program between **Aalto University** in Finland and **EURECOM** in France.

Currently, I work at **Ericsson**, mainly contributing to the backend of a 5G cloud-native cybersecurity platform.
Our tech stack includes **Django**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, **Celery**, **Kafka**, and **Kubernetes**.
I also occasionally work on the frontend with React, TypeScript, and GraphQL.
(Yes, I know GraphQL isn't frontend-only, but we use it primarily on the frontend side.)

Previously, I interned at **Siemens EDA**, where I worked on optimizing HPC workflows using AI predictions.
Before that, I developed full-stack applications at a startup in Taiwan, building real-time scoreboard systems for martial arts competitions using **Django**, **WebSockets**, and **Docker**.

Outside of tech, I‚Äôm a huge baseball fan and have been playing and following the sport for as long as I can remember.
My favorite team is the Taiwanese professional baseball team, the **Fubon Guardians**.
They haven‚Äôt exactly been doing great lately (well... for the past 8 years or so üòÖ), but their games are still fun to watch.
And if you know, you know what I mean by "fun" üòè.

I also enjoy playing baseball during the Finnish summer, and yes, there's an actual baseball league here!
Besides that, I play badminton occasionally, and try to join one 10K running event every year.
I'm also into Formula 1, and my favorite driver is **Charles Leclerc**, though I wouldn't call myself a tifosi, I can only imagine how painful that must be ü§£.

That's a bit about me! Thanks for stopping by my blog.
